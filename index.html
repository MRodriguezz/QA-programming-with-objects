				<h3>Object Oriented Programming(OOP)</h3>			
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.</p>
				<p>The programming challenge was seen as how to write the logic, not how to define the data. Object-oriented programming takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.</p>

				<h3>OPP Think about large programming projects</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>OOP is modular, meaning it allows separation of duties in object based program development. Objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors, as well as be reused within applications. Because of this, OOP provides improved software development productivity over traditional based programming.</p>
    			<p>Furthermore, object oriented software is easier to maintain. Since you have a modular design, parts of the code can be updated as needed in case of issues without making huge changes to the overall program. It also allows for faster and more cost effecient programming. With a large library of objects and codes, programmers can code faster and more effciently, which allows for less cost and more rapid output.</p>
    			<p>Finally, with OOP we can have higher quality software. With faster and more cost effecient development, more time and resources can be used to verify the software, thus outputing higher quality work.</p>

				<h3>Objects</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. An object is what actually runs in the computer.</p>

				<h3>Classes</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object. Thus an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.</p>
				<p>The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming. Among the important ideas about classes are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. In relation to each subclass, the class becomes the superclass.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are not part of their superclass.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The structure of a class and its subclasses is called the class hierarchy.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Instances</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>An instance in (OOP), is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation.</p>
				<p>Each time a program runs, it is an instance of that program. In languages that create objects from classes, an object is an instantiation of a class. That is, it is a member of a given class that has specified values rather than variables. In a non-programming context, you could think of "dog" as a class and your particular dog as an instance of that class.</p>

				<h3>Method</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>A method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class. A class (and thus an object) can have more than one method. A method in an object can only have access to the data known to that object, which ensures data integrity among the set of objects in an application. A method can be re-used in multiple objects.</p>

				<h3>Module</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>A module is a separate unit of software or hardware. Typical characteristics of modular components include portability, which allows them to be used in a variety of systems, and interoperability, which allows them to function with the components of other systems. The term was first used in architecture.</p>

				<h3>Library</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>	a library is a collection of similar objects that are stored for occasional use - most frequently, programs in source code or object code form, data files, scripts, templates, fonts, and physical storage units such as tape cartridges. Here are some common types of libraries.</p>

				<h3>Method Overriding</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>verriding is an object-oriented programming feature that enables a child class to provide different implementation for a method that is already defined and/or implemented in its parent class or one of its parent classes. The overriden method in the child class should have the same name, signature, and parameters as the one in its parent class.</p>
				<p>Overriding enables handling different data types through a uniform interface. Hence, a generic method could be defined in the parent class, while each child class provides its specific implementation for this method.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

			<div class="conceptTitle">
				<h3>Instance Variables</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="conceptDescription">
				<p>an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
				<p>An instance variable is not a Class variable although there are similarities. It is a type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between instance and class members applies to methods ("member functions") as well; a class may have both instance methods and class methods.</p>

    			<h3>What is the connection between OOP and other concepts like CSS and HTML</h3>
    		</div>
    		<div class="conceptDescription">
    			<p>While CSS and HTML are not object oriented languages, there is a link between OOP and these concepts. The same basic principal can be applied to CSS as to OOP. If we think of object oriented <b>CSS</b>, we can think of it like this:</p>
    			<p>Object oriented CSS is a coding style that allows nestable chunks of HTML via objects or modules like that in OOP, that define a section of a webpage, that then allows for reusable styling.</p>
    			<p>Ultimately this means that we would have a standard 'object', in this case an HTML structure. Then we have our CSS classes that we apply to said object which then define the look and feel.</p>
    			<p>If we apply the concept of OOP to something like CSS, we can also use method overriding to CSS Cascading. If we have a cascade in CSS that applies to its subclasses, we can override that feature just as we could in OOP. While it is not the same in execution, the concept can be applied just the same.
